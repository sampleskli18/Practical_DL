## Practice

As usual, go to `pytorch.ipynb` and follow instructions from there.

This seminar doesn't count towards final grade, yet it teaches you the framework that you're gonna use throughout all subsequent assignments.

__btw__ homework 2 should be out by now!

_There's also a theano & tensorflow assignments in `./other_frameworks` in case you want to see deep learning from a viewpoint (of static graphs). However, we strongly recommend that you begin with pytorch version unless you're already proficient with it._
